A port of phpIP from Zend Framework 1 to Laravel is ongoing here.

The back-end for operating v2 is identical to that for v1 (Apache, PHP, MySQL, and a virtual host setup pointing to the `public` sub-folder...). See the [v1 instructions](https://github.com/jjdejong/phpip/wiki/Installing). 

Check the Wiki for further details.
