A port of phpIP from Zend Framework 1 to Laravel is ongoing here.

It is quite usable at this point. Some features may still be buggy in the user interface, but the backend controlling the data and the deadlines is safe (it is mostly unchanged from v1, which has been in production for 8 years now).

Check the Wiki for further details.
