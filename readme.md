I've started work on this fork to help out on the main project.

First phase is underway - making it pretty!!!

I'm integrating an open source bootstrap theme from https://adminlte.io/ and adapting as needed.

Once phpIP is functional with the new theme (and looking good) I'll move onto functionality.
